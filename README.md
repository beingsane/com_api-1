[Joomla! API](http://edgewebworks.com/) - Generic API framework for Joomla
================================

What is it?
---------------------------------------
The Joomla! API is an extension that provides a framework for creating a RESTful API for a Joomla! site.  It is infinitely extendable through the use of the standard Joomla! plugin system.

Goals
--------------

The following are the goals of the project:

* **`RESTful Joomla! Interface`**: The purpose of this extension is to provide a standardized interface for creating RESTful API's for Joomla! sites.  Existing extensions can easily expose data by creating simple plugins.

* **`Simplicity`**: This extension's libraries and class hierarchies have been written to handle the nitty-gritty aspects of API interaction so that developers can focus solely on making their extensions accessible.

* **`Flexibility`**: The framework will allow developers to implement varying degrees of RESTful concepts in their interfaces while also giving them the flexibility to override some core functionality.

If you want to make it better
-----------------------------
Please feel free to make suggestions for ways to make this framework better or more flexible.  It is already in use on a couple live sites and I plan to keep actively developing for as long as it make sense.  I built it to my own specifications, but I would definitely be interested in suggestions for better ways of doing things. I also plan on porting it to J! 1.6 when I get a chance, so any help with that would be appreciated.
